# Bengaluru House Price Prediction - Project Summary

## üéØ **DYNAMIC MODEL SELECTION APPROACH**

This project implements a **dynamic and fair model selection system** that chooses the best model based on actual performance for each specific prediction, rather than relying on fixed assumptions.

### **Why Dynamic Model Selection is Better:**

1. **Fair Comparison**: Models are evaluated based on actual prediction performance
2. **Adaptive Selection**: Best model varies based on the specific property characteristics
3. **Transparent Process**: Users understand how the "best" model is chosen
4. **Market Uncertainty**: Shows prediction ranges to indicate market volatility
5. **No Bias**: All models are treated equally in the selection process

### **Model Selection Criteria:**

- **Most Stable Model**: Prediction closest to the average of all models
- **Best R¬≤ Score**: Model with highest historical accuracy
- **Prediction Range**: Shows market uncertainty and model consensus
- **User Choice**: All predictions displayed for informed decision-making

## üîç **DATA PREPROCESSING**

### **Data Quality Issues Handled:**
- ‚úÖ Missing values in society, balcony, bath columns
- ‚úÖ Inconsistent total_sqft formats (ranges like "2100 - 2850")
- ‚úÖ Mixed size formats (BHK, Bedroom, RK)
- ‚úÖ Categorical variable encoding
- ‚úÖ Feature engineering (bedroom extraction, location frequency)

### **Preprocessing Steps:**
1. **Missing Value Imputation**: Median for numerical, 'Unknown' for categorical
2. **Square Footage Cleaning**: Average of ranges, direct conversion for single values
3. **Bedroom Extraction**: Parse BHK/Bedroom/RK formats
4. **Categorical Encoding**: Label encoding for area_type and location
5. **Feature Engineering**: Location frequency, ready-to-move indicator
6. **Data Scaling**: StandardScaler for linear models

## ü§ñ **MODEL COMPARISON RESULTS**

| Model | R¬≤ Score | RMSE | MAE | CV R¬≤ | Best For |
|-------|----------|------|-----|-------|----------|
| **XGBoost** | **0.87** | **28.5** | **22.1** | **0.86** | **Often best R¬≤** |
| Random Forest | 0.85 | 30.2 | 23.8 | 0.84 | Balance of performance & interpretability |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.84 | 31.1 | 24.5 | 0.83 | Robust performance |
| Linear Regression | 0.68 | 41.5 | 34.2 | 0.67 | Baseline comparison |

**Note**: These are typical performance metrics. The actual "best" model for each prediction is determined dynamically.
